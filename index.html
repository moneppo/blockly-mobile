Mobile Music Lab Prototype

moneppo, 2022

This project is an experiment in making a mobile-first lab using Blockly.
Comments should read like a report or whitepaper on my findings and 
approaches.

The primary goals are to:
1. Evaluate Blockly in mobile environments, particularly since it's built 
   on web technologies
2. Evaluate customization of Blockly using the new extension capabilities
   added over the past year
3. Try out the music lab experience and new UX
