Mobile Music Lab Prototype

moneppo, 2022

This project is an experiment in making a mobile-first lab using Blockly.
Comments should read like a report or whitepaper on my findings and 
approaches.

The primary goals are to:
1. Evaluate Blockly in mobile environments, particularly since it's built 
   on web technologies
2. Evaluate customization of Blockly using the new extension capabilities
   added over the past year
3. Try out the music lab experience and new UX designs, such as full-screen
   block-editing.

The primary content begins in [script.js](script.js).

I'm using ES6 modules as much as possible as that's where the web is moving. Granted this 
doesn't work for Blockly, but for the rest of the prototype it makes things very straight forward.
