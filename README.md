# Blockly Mobile  Prototype

This project is an experiment in making a mobile-first lab using Blockly.

The primary goals are to:
1. Evaluate Blockly in mobile environments, particularly since it's built 
   on web technologies
2. Evaluate customization of Blockly using the new extension capabilities
   added over the past year
