# Blockly Mobile  Prototype

This project is an experiment in making a mobile-first lab using Blockly.

The primary goals are to:
1. Evaluate Blockly in mobile environments, particularly since it's built 
   on web technologies
2. Evaluate customization of Blockly using the new extension capabilities
   added over the past year
   
# Getting Started
1. `git clone https://github.com/moneppo/blockly-mobile`
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn run dev`

To add a block, select a color and an icon from the "+" menu. While there's blockly code for when the program is run and when a button is pressed, the code is not configured to actually run. Buttons will simply make a sound when pressed.
